- 👋 Hi, I’m @NihongoScript
- 👀 and interested in photography, cooking, fitness... and as my name already indicates: japanese language and culture. Programming lately also joined my list of interests.
- 💻 While trying to reach Japanese Level N4 by End of 2023 and becoming a professional Developer by End of 2024 I'm working full-time as a Mechanical Engineer in the railway industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of JavaScript by taking part in the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate Course via Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on simple projects and helping each other on our way to become professional Front-End Developers. I really hope that from some point onwards, I'll also be able to help others with their programming challenges and support them on their journey.
- 🏠 Living in Vienna, Austria, but grew up in Germany.
